# Day 1 – AWS Admin Setup

## Objective
- Secure the AWS root account with MFA.
- Create an IAM admin user (`cl0udadmin`) for daily use instead of root.

## Steps Completed
1. Signed up for AWS Free Tier account.
2. Enabled MFA on the root account.
3. Created IAM user `cl0udadmin` with:
   - AdministratorAccess policy
   - IAMUserChangePassword policy
4. Logged out of root → confirmed login with `cl0udadmin`.

## Key Learnings
- Root account should only be used for billing and emergencies.
- MFA adds a second layer of defense.
- Admin users can be created to handle daily tasks securely.

## Evidence
- MFA successfully enabled for root.
- `cl0udadmin` created and used for login.

# Day 2 – IAM Permissions Lab (ReadOnly User)

## Objective
- Understand the principle of least privilege in AWS.
- Compare Admin user vs. ReadOnly user.

## Steps Completed
1. Logged in as `cl0udadmin` (Admin IAM user).
2. Created IAM user `readonly-user` with:
   - Console login enabled
   - ReadOnlyAccess policy attached
3. Logged in as `readonly-user` and tested actions.

## Results
- ✅ Able to view S3 buckets and IAM users.
- ❌ Attempted to create a new S3 bucket → *Access Denied*.
- ❌ Attempted to add a new IAM user → *Access Denied*.

### Example Error Output

```
User: arn:aws:iam::693986728494:user/cl0udreadonly
Action: iam:CreateUser
Resource: arn:aws:iam::693986728494:user/testing-readonly
Result: AccessDenied – no identity-based policy allows the action
```


## Key Learnings
- ReadOnlyAccess policy allows visibility without modification.
- Demonstrates the **Principle of Least Privilege** — users should only have permissions they truly need.

## Evidence
- Verified login as `readonly-user`.
- AWS console produced “Access Denied” when attempting restricted actions.
